Version 1.1.0
  * Restructured code to make it easier to embed mimetex as a library call (future goal)
  * Bad expressions (at least some, as mimetex and mathtex acceps faulty input) no longer stop the rest of the message to be modified.
  * Alot less notifications, only for the usual errors (use debug window for more information).
  * Replaced Gregex with purple string utilities, so newer versios now work on windows too.
  * Fixed a few minor memory leaks.
  * Fixed large memory leak (clearing imgstore when closing conversation).
  * Major code rewrite, using GLib everywhere now and code looks nicer and 150 LOC shorter.
  * Fixed value for smallest font size (tiny = 0)
  * Uses purples debug log instead of printf, eliminating the need for a debug version.
  * Removed need for mimetex.bat in windows (I had missed -e in mimetex)
  * Removed system() and the need for the previous hacks related to it.
  * Fixed up documentation and licenses. Since I could only find the GPL3 license i also updated it. Hopefull I've done everything right, otherwise feel free to correct me.

Version 1.0.7
  * Reverted change in 1.0.6, but added a double escape to \\ strings (i.e \\\\ instead). Now ' works again and also linebreaks. Yay.

Version 1.0.6
  * Change " to ' when sending system calls. Stops the terminal from removing an escapesequence, namely  \\ to \. This should make it easier to have linebreaks in for example arrays.

Version 1.0.5
  * Fixed Ubuntu-bug where system() returned errors. There are still errors, but i'm just ignoring them at they still seem to work

Version 1.0.4
  * Fixed makefile to only require purple-dev, not pidgin-dev
  * Support for windows. See wiki pages or README

Version 1.0.3
  * Fixed cross compilation for Win32
  * Fixed escaped apostrohpes (prime sign ')
  * Added DEBUG option in makefile. Prints out debug information if compiled with make DEBUG=1

Version 1.0.2
  * Fixed bug where incoming message were not rendered.
  * Improved error message for missing renderer.
  * Fixed silly mistake in header file
  * Changed homepage

Version 1.0.1
  * Warning message when image can't be sent.
  * Redesign of signal handling.
  * Removed potential (but inlikely) memory leak.

Version 1.0.0
  * Initial version
