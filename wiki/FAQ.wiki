===Should I use mimeTeX or mathTeX?===
_If you don't want to install latex and dvipng use mimeTeX.
If you have latex then install dvipng and mathTeX since it renders better images
and supports the PNG-format instead of only GIF_

===Will the person I'm talking to see the rendered expression?===
_Yes if he/she has a similiar plugin installed or if you send the image._

===Why wouldn't I want to send the image?===
_The person you are talking to might have another background color or have some other settings for the image that he/she prefers.
You also need to be in Direct IM mode in order to send images inside message.
You most likely do not want to select this option._

==mimeTeX==
===It's not working===
_Check to see that mimeTeX is installed. 
You should get a gif image from_

_If not, get mimetex or make sure the binary is in some directory that's included in your PATH._

===Colors aren't working===

`mimetex`
